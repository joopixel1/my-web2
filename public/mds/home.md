# Hi, **I am lekan!** I do software development for fun and profit.

### Educational Experience 
I’m currently working on completing my 4 year degree in Computer Engineering from Iowa State University(ISU). At ISU, I’m part of the software subteam pf the Prisum Solar Car Club at ISU. In this role I have worked on writing low-level software for a Compute Tester(a board to test Codules for Solar Car for diagnosis and verification), and also worked on other modules in the car. I also plan to start a research in microarchitectural security with Dr. Berk Gulzomeglu.

### Professional Experience and Career Objectives
I currently work part-time in the Software Development team at Iowa State University. We develop fullstack code for the university webpage and staff webpage, using XAMPP stack, while using React for the frontend. I have worked there for about a year now, and have learned a lot about software development as a team and for a real product. 
I have learnt how to develop web apps and android apps, which is fun and quite cool. But as I take more computer Engineering classes I become more intrigued with the hardware part of it, which led me to join the Prisum club to develop code at the lower level for microcontrollers. I am still developing myself on this and would love to dive deeper in the future.
